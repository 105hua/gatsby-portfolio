<h1 align="center">My Portfolio Website.</h1>

This is a Portfolio Website that I have recently started working on in an effort to learn React. I chose to use Gatsby because of it's support for multiple static pages. The main intention of this project is to eventually become the replacement for my old Portfolio
Website, which was hosted on github.io.
