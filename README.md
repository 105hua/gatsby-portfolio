# My Portfolio Website

This is a Portfolio Website that I have recently started working on in an effort to learn React. I chose to use Gatsby because of it's support for multiple static pages. Hopefully this project turns into a replacement for my existing portfolio, which I have recently taken
down, as I eventually decided that I was not satisfied with it.
